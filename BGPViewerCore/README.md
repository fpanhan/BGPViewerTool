# .NET Developers
If you're a .NET developer you can use the core library on your application. Download [BGPViewerCore](https://github.com/wallacemariadeandrade/BGPViewerTool/tree/development/BGPViewerCore), add a reference to it on your project and go code! :sunglasses:

You can also download just dll files and reference it directly. It's your call.

See the tests section in order to understand how it works and how you'll can use its powers.
