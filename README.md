A tool to help network analysts get information about prefixes and ASN's from command line. Built on netstandard2.0 and based on [BGPView API](https://bgpview.docs.apiary.io/#reference).

There are a few ways to use this repo content, so scroll down and have fun! :smile:

:construction: It's under construction :construction:

## .NET Developers
If you're a .NET developer you can use the core library on your application. Download [BGPViewerCore](https://github.com/wallacemariadeandrade/BGPViewerTool/tree/development/BGPViewerCore), add a reference to it on your project and go code! :sunglasses:


## Windows, Mac or Linux User (.NET Core Solution)
Use can use the .NET Core solution [BGPViewerConsoleTool](https://github.com/wallacemariadeandrade/BGPViewerTool/tree/development/BGPViewerConsoleTool). It's a command line client built on NET Core, a cross-platform version of .NET for building websites, services, and console apps.

To use this tool you'll must have installed NET Core Runtime, which one you can get [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).


## Windows, Mac or Linux User (Powershell Solution)
If you're a normal human (maybe not so normal cause you probably work with telecom :laughing::sweat_smile:) and likes Powershell, then you can use [BGPViewerPowerTool](https://github.com/wallacemariadeandrade/BGPViewerTool/tree/development/BGPViewerPowerTool)! It's a bunch of PowerShell scripts that do all the work for you. Download the folder and call the scripts from PowerShell prompt at scripts directory.

> [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/pt-br/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7) is a cross-platform task automation and configuration management framework, consisting of a command-line shell and scripting language. Unlike most shells, which accept and return text, PowerShell is built on top of the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR), and accepts and returns .NET objects. This fundamental change brings entirely new tools and methods for automation.
